PASSWORD SECURITY & AUTHENTICATION ANALYSIS

1. Introduction
Password security is a critical aspect of cyber security. Weak passwords can be easily compromised, leading to unauthorized access. This task focuses on understanding how passwords are stored, attacked, and protected.

2. Hashing vs Encryption
Hashing is a one-way process used to store passwords securely. Once hashed, the original password cannot be retrieved.
Encryption is a two-way process where data can be decrypted using a key.

Hashing is preferred for password storage because it prevents attackers from recovering the original password.

3. Common Hash Types
MD5:
- Fast hashing algorithm
- Easily broken
- Not secure

SHA-1:
- More secure than MD5
- Vulnerable to modern attacks

bcrypt:
- Slow and secure
- Uses salting
- Recommended for password storage

4. Password Hash Generation
Passwords are converted into hashes before storing in databases. Even if attackers access the database, they only see hashes, not plain passwords.

5. Password Cracking Techniques

Brute Force Attack:
- Tries all possible combinations
- Time-consuming but effective for short passwords

Dictionary Attack:
- Uses common password lists
- Faster than brute force
- Very effective against weak passwords

6. Why Weak Passwords Fail
Weak passwords:
- Are short
- Use common words
- Lack symbols and numbers
- Can be cracked quickly using dictionary attacks

7. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring:
- Something you know (password)
- Something you have (OTP, phone)
- Something you are (biometrics)

Even if a password is compromised, MFA prevents unauthorized access.

8. Recommendations for Strong Authentication
- Use long passwords (12+ characters)
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid common words
- Use bcrypt or similar hashing algorithms
- Enable MFA wherever possible

9. Conclusion
This task provided practical knowledge of password attacks and defenses. Strong passwords, secure hashing, and MFA are essential to protect systems from unauthorized access.
